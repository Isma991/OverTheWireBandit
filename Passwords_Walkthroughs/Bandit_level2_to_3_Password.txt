So, for this level, it's quite simple. 
You just need to
	1. Run the "ls" command to list the directory. 
	2. After that, a file named "spaces in this filename" will appear. You need to run the command "cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename". 
	Since there are spaces in the filename, you must add a "\" at the end of each word to indicate that there's a space after it. 

(Pro tip: you can just type "cat spaces" and then press the "Tab" key to auto-complete the filename.) 
This way, you will find the password for the third level. 
(I recommend noting down your passwords in a document.)
