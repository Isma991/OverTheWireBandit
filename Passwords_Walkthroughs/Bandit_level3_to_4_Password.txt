So, for this level, it's quite simple. 
You just need to 
 	1.Run the "ls" command to list the directory. 
	2.After that, a directory named "inhere" will appear. 
	3.You should then run the command "cd inhere" to navigate into the "inhere" directory. 
	4.Next, you need to re-run the "ls" command, but this time with the "-al" argument to list everything in the directory, including hidden 	files and directories. 
	5.You will see a file named "...Hiding-From-You" appear. 
	6.All you need to do now is run the command "cat ...Hiding-From-You" (yes, the "..." are mandatory) to display its content.
This way, you'll find the password to go from the third to the fourth level. 
(I recommend noting down your passwords in a document.)
