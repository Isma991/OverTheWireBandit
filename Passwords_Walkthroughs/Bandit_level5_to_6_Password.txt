So, for this level, it's quite simple. You just need to 
	1.Run the "ls" command to list the directory. 
	2.After that, a directory named "inhere" will appear. 
	3.You should then run the command "cd inhere" to navigate into the "inhere" directory. 
	4.Next, you need to re-run the "ls" command. You will find 20 directories named "maybehere00" to "maybehere19". 
	5.To find which file contains the password, simply run the "find" command with the arguments "-type f" to indicate that you're searching for 	files, and then add the argument "-size 1033c" to look for files that are exactly 1033 bytes. 
	6.The command will be: find . -type f -size 1033c
	7.Once executed, you will see the path to the file that contains what you're looking for. 
	8.Itâ€™s very important to run this command within the "inhere" directory. 
	9.The path will look something like "./maybehere0*/.file*". 
	10.Finally, run the command cat ./maybehere0*/.file* (replace the asterisks with the correct numbers from the results).

This way, you'll find the password to move from the fifth to the sixth level. (I recommend noting down your passwords in a document.)
