So, for this level, it's quite simple. You just need to 
1. Run the "ls" command to list the directory. 
2. After that, a file named "-" will appear. 
3. You need to run the command "cat ./-" which means to execute, in the current directory (hence the "."), the file named "-". 
You cannot run the command "cat -" directly, as the operating system will keep echoing back whatever you type until you press "Ctrl + D" to exit. This way, you will find the password for the second level. 
(I recommend noting down your passwords in a document.)
