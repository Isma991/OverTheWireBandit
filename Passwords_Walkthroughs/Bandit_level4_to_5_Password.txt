So, for this level, it's quite simple. You just need to 
	1. Run the "ls" command to list the directory. 
	2.After that, a directory named "inhere" will appear. 
	3.You should then run the command "cd inhere" to navigate into the "inhere" directory. 
	4.Next, you need to re-run the "ls" command. You will find 10 files named "-file00" to "-file09". 
	5.To find which file contains the password, simply run the command "file ./", which will display the type of each file in the current 	directory, which is "inhere". 
	6.You'll see that one of the files will contain "ASCII text", while the rest will be "data" files. 
	7.Then, run the command "cat ./-file0" (replace the asterisk with the correct file number) to display the content.

This way, you'll find the password to move from the fourth to the fifth level. 
(I recommend noting down your passwords in a document.)
