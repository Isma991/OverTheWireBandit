So, for this level, it's quite simple. You just need to 
	1. Run the command "find /" to search through all directories, followed by the arguments "-type f" to indicate you're looking for files, and "-size 33c" which, as in the previous level, specifies that the file size is exactly 33 bytes. 
	2.However, three new arguments are added: 	
		1. The first is "-user bandit7" which specifies that the file belongs to the user "bandit7", 
		2. The second is "-group bandit6" indicating that the file also belongs to the "bandit6" group (which likely includes your current user), 
		3.And finally, the third argument "2>/dev/null" is used to suppress error messages from files you don't have permission to access, showing only the files you can.

	3.The command will look like:
	find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
	(The order of the arguments doesn't matter after the "type" argument, but the command must end with "2>/dev/null").	
	4. Once executed, you'll be given the path to the file containing the password. 
	5.Youâ€™ll just need to run the command: "cat /****/****/****.password" (replace the "****" with the directories provided by the command output).

This way, you'll find the password to move from the sixth to the seventh level. (I recommend noting down your passwords in a document.)
